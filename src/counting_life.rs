/*
Like naive_life in that we use a fixed size contiguous array to store cell states, but instead of just storing
alive/dead state as a boolean, we store that and the number of live neighbors the cell has. Anytime a new cell is born,
we add one to the neighbors count for each of its neighbors. This avoids having to count neighbors for cells in large
dead zones. Still limited to a fixed size world though...
